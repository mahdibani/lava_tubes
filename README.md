# Lava Tubes Detection Project

## Overview
This project focuses on the detection of lava tubes in satellite imagery using machine learning techniques. Lava tubes are natural conduits formed by flowing lava, and their detection is crucial for understanding volcanic activity, assessing hazards, and exploring potential habitats for future extraterrestrial missions.

## Project Description
The goal of this project is to develop a robust model capable of accurately identifying lava tubes in various types of imagery, including satellite and aerial photographs. Using a combination of data augmentation techniques and a YOLO (You Only Look Once) architecture, we aim to enhance the model's precision and recall rates.

### Objectives:
- To accurately detect and classify lava tubes in satellite images.
- To minimize false positives and false negatives in model predictions.
- To visualize the detection results effectively.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of labeled images that contain lava tubes and other geological features. The images were sourced from [insert source, e.g., public datasets, satellite imagery], and the annotations include bounding boxes around identified lava tubes.

- **Number of Images**: [insert number]
- **Classes**: 
  - Lava Tube 1
  - Lava Tube 2
  - Random
